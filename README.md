In my project for Sunbase, I was tasked with developing a robust machine learning model to predict customer churn. I meticulously processed and analyzed a comprehensive dataset, handling missing values and outliers while engineering new features to enhance prediction accuracy. Leveraging a range of machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks, I systematically trained, validated, and optimized each model to achieve the best results.
After a rigorous evaluation process using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, I identified the most effective model. This model was fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation to ensure its predictive performance was at its peak.
The final step involved deploying the chosen model into a development environment, enabling it to seamlessly predict customer churn in real-time. This comprehensive approach allowed Sunbase to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and make informed decisions to mitigate churn, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and retention rates.
